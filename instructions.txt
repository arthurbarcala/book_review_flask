Here's a Python Flask project idea that you can practice:

Title: "Book Review Website"

Description:
Create a web application using Flask where users can search for books, read reviews, and write their own reviews.
The application will utilize the Goodreads API to fetch book information and ratings.

Features:

1. User Registration and Authentication:

Users can create new accounts and log in to the website.
Passwords should be securely hashed and stored in the database.
User authentication should be implemented to protect certain routes.

2. Book Search:

Users can search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
Utilize the Goodreads API or another book database API to fetch book information.


3. Book Details and Reviews:

Display detailed information about a book, including its title, author, publication year, ISBN, and average rating.
Show a list of reviews for each book, including the reviewer's name and rating.
Allow users to rate and write their own reviews for books they have read.

4. User Profile:

Users can view and edit their profiles.
Display the user's information, including their name, email, and a list of books they have reviewed.

5. User Recommendations:

Implement a recommendation system that suggests books to users based on their previous ratings and reviews.

6. Admin Panel:

Create an admin panel with restricted access for administrators.
Administrators can manage user accounts, delete inappropriate reviews, and perform other administrative tasks.

7. User Interface:

Design a clean and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Make the website responsive and accessible on different devices.

8. Deployment:

Deploy the Flask application to a hosting platform such as Heroku or PythonAnywhere.

This project will allow you to practice various aspects of web development using Flask, 
including routing, form handling, database operations, user authentication, API integration, and more.
It will also give you an opportunity to work with a third-party API and implement a recommendation
system. Have fun coding!
